        "### Theorem  \n",
        "If the optimal solution uses $k$ sets, the greedy algorithm finds a solution with at most $k \\ln n$ sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Proof:\n",
        "Since the optimal solution uses $k$ sets, there must some set that covers at least a $1/k$ fraction of the points. The algorithm chooses the set that covers the most points, so it covers at least that many. Therefore, after the first iteration of the algorithm, there are at most $n(1 - 1/k)$ points left. Again, since the optimal solution uses $k$ sets, there must some set that covers at least a $1/k$ fraction of the remainder (if we got lucky we might have chosen one of the sets used by the optimal solution and so there are actually $k - 1$ sets covering the remainder, but we canâ€™t count on that necessarily happening). So, again, since we choose the set that covers the most points remaining, after the second iteration, there are at most $n(1 - 1/k)^2$ points left. More generally, after $t$ rounds, there are at most $n(1 - 1/k)^t$ points left. After $t = k \\ln n$ rounds, there are at most $n(1 - 1/k)^{k \\ln n} < n(1/e)^{\\ln n} = 1$ points left, which means we must be done. &#9632;\n",
